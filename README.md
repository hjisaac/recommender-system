## Algorithms


### Alternating Least Squares (ALS)

**ALS** is a collaborative filtering technique based on **matrix factorization**. It models user and item interactions by discovering latent features that explain observed ratings. The algorithm alternates between optimizing user and item matrices to minimize the regularized objective function:

- Without item features modeled:
  
$$
\min_{U, V} \lambda \sum_{(i,j) \in \mathcal{R}} (r_{ij} - (U_i^T V_j + b^{(u)}_i + b^{(v)}_j))^2 + \tau (\|U\|^2 + \|V\|^2) + \gamma (\|b^{(u)}\|^2 + \|b^{(v)}\|^2)
$$

- With item features modeled:

$$
\min_{U, V} \lambda \sum_{(i,j) \in \mathcal{R}} (r_{ij} - (U_i^T V_j + b^{(u)}_i + b^{(v)}_j))^2 + \tau (\|U\|^2 + \|V\|^2) + \gamma (\|b^{(u)}\|^2 + \|b^{(v)}\|^2)
$$

Where:
- $U$: Matrix of user latent factors $n \times k$.
- $V$: Matrix of item latent factors $m \times k$.
- $F$: Matrix of feature (when item features are also modeled) 
- $b^{(u)}$: Matrix of the user biases $1 \times k$.
- $b^{(v)}$: Matrix of the item biases $1 \times k$.
- $r_{ij}$: Observed rating for user $i$ and item $j$.
- $\lambda$: Regularization parameters accounting for the prediction residuals
- $\tau$: Regularization parameters accounting for $U$ and $V$
- $\gamma$: Regularization parameters accounting for $b^{(u)}$ and $b^{(v)}$

#### Workflow

1. Solve the optimization problem for $b^{(u)}$ keeping all the other matrices (.i.e $U$, $V$, $b^{(v)}$) fixed.

    ![Equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?b^{(u)}_i=\frac{\lambda\sum_{j\in\Omega(i)}\left(r_{ij}-\left(u_i^T&space;v_j&plus;b_j^{(v)}\right)\right)}{\lambda|\Omega(i)|&plus;\gamma})

2. Solve the optimization problem for $U$ keeping all the other matrices fixed.

    ![Equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?u_i=\left(\lambda\sum_{j\in\Omega(i)}v_j&space;v_j^T&plus;\tau&space;I\right)^{-1}\left(\lambda\sum_{j\in\Omega(i)}v_j(r_{ij}-b^{(u)}_i-b^{(v)}_j)\right))

3. Solve the optimization problem for $b^{(v)}$ keeping all the other matrices fixed.

    ![Equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?b^{(v)}_j=\frac{\lambda\sum_{i\in\Omega(j)}\left(r_{ij}-\left(u_i^T&space;v_j&plus;b_i^{(u)}\right)\right)}{\lambda|\Omega(j)|&plus;\gamma})
   
4. Solve the optimization problem for $V$ keeping all the other matrices fixed.
   - When F is modeled:
   
      ![Equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?v_j=\left(\lambda\sum_{i\in\Omega(j)}u_i&space;u_i^T&plus;\tau&space;I\right)^{-1}\left(\lambda\sum_{i\in\Omega(j)}u_i(r_{ij}-b^{(u)}_i-b^{(v)}_j)&plus;\sum_{\substack{t\in\text{features}(j)}}f_t\right))
   
   - When is not modeled:
   
      ![Equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?v_j=\left(\lambda\sum_{i\in\Omega(j)}u_i^Tu_i&plus;\tau&space;I\right)^{-1}\left(\lambda\sum_{i\in\Omega(j)}u_i(r_{ij}-b^{(u)}_i-b^{(v)}_j)\right))
   
5. (When F modeled) Solve the optimization problem for $F$ keeping all the other matrices fixed.

    ![Equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?f_l=\left(\lambda\sum_{i\in\Omega(j)}u_i&space;u_i^T&plus;\tau&space;I\right)^{-1}\left(\lambda\sum_{i\in\Omega(j)}u_i(r_{ij}-b^{(u)}_i-b^{(v)}_j)&plus;\sum_{\substack{t\in\text{features}(j)}}f_t\right))

6. Repeat until convergence.


#### Advantages

## Datasets

The folder `dataset` contains information about examples' dataset.

## Installation

To set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hjisaac/recommender-system.git
   cd recommender-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Run an example**:
   To run the movielens example, download the dataset from [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).
   Ideally, put that dataset in the example folder and change the path of rating.csv file passed to the indexer.
   And run `poetry run python examples/path_to_example_file.py`
   
---  

## Usage

Only collaborative filtering is implemented now, and it is encaspsulated in the class `CollaborativeFilteringRecommenderBuilder`.

   ```py
   from src.recommenders import CollaborativeFilteringRecommenderBuilder
   # ...
   # Create everything needed instance the builder (indexed_data, backend that will run the proper algorithm..)
   # ...
   # Instantiate the builder with all the necessary arguments
   recommander_builder = CollaborativeFilteringRecommenderBuilder(*args, *kwars)  
   
   # Build the recommender now by calling the build on the builder to get the recommender (Kinda an implementation of the builder design pattern).
   # This will basically train the recommendation model, so it will take some time depending on the dataset size and the parameters.
   recommender = recommander_builder.build(*args, **kwargs)
   
   # To recommend, call the recommend method of the recommender object with a list of rating. E.g: [(item1, rating1), ..]
   recommender.recommend(input_ratings)
   
   # If called without arguments, the recommender will recommend best rated items.
   recommender.recommend()
   ```

   The script outputs RMSE and Loss values for both training and testing, providing insight into the system's predictive accuracy.
    And those values can be accessed later from the model and be plotted using the graphing utils if the model has been saved 
    (to save the model as checkpoint, one can pass `save_checkpoint=True` to the backend object used to do the training). There are 
   also some logs that will be generated in the `artifacts/logs` folder each time the backend runs. Those logs can be very usefull
    for debugging purposes.

---

## Performance

The first example implemented to access performance uses the [**MovieLens dataset**](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).

**Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** is used as the primary evaluation metric:

$$
RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{(i,j) \in \mathcal{R}} (r_{ij} - \hat{r}_{ij})^2}
$$

Where:
- $r_{ij}$: Actual rating.
- $\hat{r}_{ij} = U_i^T V_j + b^{(u)}_i + b^{(v)}_j$: Predicted rating.

### Results (Example)

## Limitations 

Running the MovieLens example (32 million ratings) takes approximately 3 hours on CPU alone.

The early use of `SerialUnidirectionalMapper` and `SerialBidirectionalMapper` data structures 
complicates integrating [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/). These classes lack clear type specifications, making it nearly 
impossible to leverage **Numba**'s optimization capabilities. To use Numba effectively, we would 
need to remove these data structures from the code. There is an issue opened to fix that.

## Improvements

- **Integration of Additional Algorithms**: Incorporate other collaborative filtering and content-based methods.
- **Hybrid Recommender Systems**: Combine collaborative and content-based filtering for improved performance.
- **More Examples**: Implement more examples potentially with different datasets for real-time recommendations.
- **Numba and Jax**: Currently it is not possible to use numba/jax, cause the code contains a lot of custom objects. Plan a fix.
- **Issues**: Resolve the remaining issues, including the adding of unit tests.
- **Comparison**: Compare with existing libraries.
